# OpenBook - The Open-Source Tool for Generating HTML Books

The aim of this project is to develop a convenient tool for generating online books. I want that the books generated be readable in any browser and on any-sized device (from smartphones to desktops). The tool gets the book sources in a Markdown format (particularly the dialect of Markdown proposed by the [Leanpub.com](https://leanpub.com/help/manual) website) and produces HTML files readable in a browser on output. Then the generated files can be published on the Internet on a cheap or a free web hosting, or even at [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The publisher can get revenue by showing the [Google Adsense Ads](https://www.google.com/intl/ru_ru/adsense/start/#/?modal_active=none) on the book pages.  

## Background 

This project originated as an HTML files generator for my open-source PHP programming book, [Using Zend Framework 3](https://github.com/olegkrivtsov/using-zend-framework-3-book). I wanted to have a console tool for generating the static HTML files of the book from Markdown sources and referenced PNG images. I didn't find ready tools that are convenient enough, so I decided to create my own tool.

## Features

Currently you can do the following using this tool:
 
 * Generate HTML files from Markdown (`.md`) sources using the command-line interface. 
 * Automatically check for some errors/mistakes in your `.md` files and report them saving your time.
 * Validate external web resources mentioned in book text to avoid broken links.
 * Embed a [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) tag, so you are able to see visitor statistics for your book website.
 * Embed a [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) message thread, so readers of your book are able to leave comments under chapter pages.
 * Embed [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense) ads to get revenue from your online free book.
 * Produce book pages for several languages (e.g. English, Russian, and Spanish).
 * Produce HTML book with all necessary images included ready for publishing on a static web hosting (like GitHub Pages).
 * Develop the book in a distributed way, if you have several co-authors that know how to use a version control system, like Git.

## License

This project uses the [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) license. It is a very permissive license, so you can use this project without almost any limitations.

## Installation

To install the tool, you first need to install the PHP engine (version 5.6 or later will work). 

In Linux Ubuntu you can do that with the following command:

`sudo apt-get install php`

In Linux CentOS you can do that with the command:

`sudo yum install php`

If the instructions above do not work in your OS, please [search](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+php) for relevant instructions.

Then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this repository or [download](https://github.com/olegkrivtsov/openbook/archive/master.zip) it as a ZIP archive and unpack somewhere.

Go to the directory where you put the files and type the following commands to install the PHP dependency packages:

```
php composer.phar self-update
php composer.phar install
```

## Command-line Usage

Once the installation is done, you can run the tool with the following command:

`php openbook.php [options] <book_dir>`

Currently the following options are supported:

 * *-v* - output as much info to screen as possible
 * *-l* - validate links to external websites in the book text to avoid unnecessary 404 Not Found errors when a reader clicks the link. If you specify this option, the book may be generated more slowly. 

## Book Structure

If you want to briefly review an example of a ready book, take a look at the GitHub repository where I store the sources of my book, [Using Zend Framework 3](https://github.com/olegkrivtsov/using-zend-framework-3-book). If you find the structure of that repository confusing, please see below for clarification.

The files of the book are organized in the following manner:

```
<book_dir>/
  manuscript/
    en/
      images/
      Book.txt
      preface.txt
      acknowledgments.txt
      chapter1.txt
      chapter2.txt
      ...
    ru/
      images/
      Book.txt
      preface.txt
      acknowledgments.txt
      chapter1.txt
      chapter2.txt
      ...
    another-lang/
      images/
      Book.txt
      ...
  openbook.json  
```

The *manuscript* directory is the directory where Markdown files of the book are stored. The *en/*, *ru/*, *another-lang/* are directories where the Markdown files for a specific language are stored. The *images* directory is the directory where you should place the PNG images you want to reference in the book text. 

### Properties File

`openbook.json` should be a file in JSON format containing book properties, like its title,
subtitle, copyright information, etc. An example of a real-life `openbook.json` is presented below:

```
{
    "book_title": "Using Zend Framework 3",
    "book_subtitle": "A free and open-source book about Zend Framework",
    "copyright": "2018 by Oleg Krivtsov",
    "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
    "book_website": "https://olegkrivtsov.github.io/using-zend-framework-3-book/html",
    "keywords": [
        "php",
        "zend framework",
        "book",
        "tutorial",
        "documentation",
        "learn",
        "free"
    ],
    "links": {
        "Home": "https://olegkrivtsov.github.io/using-zend-framework-3-book/html",
        "Samples": "https://github.com/olegkrivtsov/using-zf3-book-samples",
        "Class Reference": "https://olegkrivtsov.github.io/zf3-api-reference/html/",
        "Contribute": "https://github.com/olegkrivtsov/using-zend-framework-3-book"
    },
    "languages": {
        "en": "English",
        "ru": "Русский",
        "es": "Español"
    },
    "incomplete_translations": ["es"],
    "google_analytics": {
        "enabled": true,
        "account_id": "UA-80824388-1"
    },
    "google_adsence": {
        "enabled": true, 
        "contents_ad": "data/contents_ad.js",
        "chapter_upper_ad": "data/upper_ad.js",
        "chapter_bottom_ad": "data/bottom_ad.js"
    },
    "disqus": {
        "enabled": true,
        "src": "//using-zend-framework-3-book.disqus.com/embed.js"
    }
}
```

The `Book.txt` file should contain the list of chapters to include into the book:

```
preface.txt
acknowledgments.txt
chapter1.txt
chapter2.txt
chapter3.txt
...
```
## Generating Your Book

You can generate the book with the following command:

```
php openbook.php /path/to/your/book
```

If everything is OK, you'll find the HTML files in `/path/to/your/book/html` directory.
